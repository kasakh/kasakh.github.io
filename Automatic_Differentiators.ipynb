    "Consider a function $h(x)=f(x)g(x)$ and the multiplication rule in the above equation. Since $h$ is a product, $h(x)$ and $\\frac{d}{dx}h(x)$ have some common components, namely $f(x)$ and $g(x)$. Note also that on the right hand side, $f(x)$ and $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$ appear separately. If we just proceeded to symbolically differentiate $f(x)$ and plugged its derivative into the appropriate place, we would have nested duplications of any computation that appears in common between $f(x)$ and $\\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$. Hence, careless symbolic differentiation can easily produce exponentially large symbolic expressions which take correspondingly long to evaluate. This problem is known as **expression swell**.\n",

    "When we are concerned with the accurate numerical evaluation of derivatives and not so much with their actual symbolic form, it is in principle possible to significantly simplify computations by storing only the values of intermediate sub-expressions in memory. Moreover, for further efficiency, we can interleave as much as possible the differentiation and simplification steps. This interleaving idea forms the basis of AD and provides an account of its simplest form: **apply symbolic differentiation at the elementary operation level and keep intermediate numerical results, in lockstep with the evaluation of the main function.** \n",

    "To illustrate the problem, consider the following example: Iterations of the logistic map $l_{n+1}=4l_n (1-l_n)$, $l_1=x$ and the corresponding derivatives of $l_n$ with respect to $x$, illustrating expression swell."

    "The thing to note is that evaluating the AD way is computationally linear wrt $n$ (because we add only one $(1-l_n - l_n)$ for each increase by 1) whereas using the SD way is exponential (as evident in the table above). This linear timecomplexity is achieved due to carry-over of the derivatives at each step, rather than evaluating the derivative at the end and subsituting the value of x. This is the crux of AD. Of course, there are other important differences between AD vs SD but they are not considered here. \n"
