    "Actually, you can safely use this model for predicting relationship between $X_1 & Y$. There is no need to do any F-test or T-test. In fact, only to perform the F-test or t-test, we require the above LINC assumptions. The whole point of testing comes when we are trying to estimate the relationship $b_1$ using the sample data available. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we use the sample data and perform OLS, we get an estimate of $b_1$ which is usually denoted as $\\beta_1$. The first assumption in LINC, which is Linear, states that $E(\\epsilon)=0$, which means that $\\beta_1$ is an unbiased estimator of $b_1$. Why?\n",

    "$Y = \\beta_0 +\\beta_1 * X_1 +\\epsilon$ is our regression equation we get from the sample. Now if $E(\\epsilon)=0$, this means that $\\hat Y = b_0 + b_1*X_1$. \n",
